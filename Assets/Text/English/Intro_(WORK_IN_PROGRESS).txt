=== MESSAGE INTERFACE ===

>> You are on a secure line.

Something came up, and we've got a job for you.

Rheinsberg Nuclear Powerplant
Kernkraftwerk Rheinsberg (K.K.R.)
WWER type reactor

Experienced a tear in the tubing of a cooling 
circuit in sector alpha.

This was noticed quickly and the signal was sent. 

Under normal circumstances, the problem would've 
been resolved before the public even heard about it.

But there was no response back, and the whole 
place went up in flames. Sabotage is suspected.

//

Teens and crackheads in the area are getting too 
curious and exploring areas they're not supposed to.

Although we've lost any visual feed on the 
facilities, motion sensors are being tripped. 

Most of these are likely false-alarms or just 
some animal that got lost, but we have reason to 
believe that outsiders and a number of personnel 
are still inside.

We've sent the signal to remotely close the doors, 
but it's only a matter of time before they find 
their way out.

//

You'll be issued with a standard law 
enforcement pistol among other things.

>> "Am I to arrest trespassers?"
>> Message sent

Arrest? No, these people are fucking with actual 
top-secret facilities. They need to be put down 
like a rabid dog.

This operation is extremely secretive, so funds 
are scarce.

However, this facility was extensively stocked 
in the event of an emergency. You'll find more 
equipment in these locations.

We heavily advice you to take whatever equipment 
you can find - anything you think's useful.
