^n

	Something came up, and we've got a job for you.
^n

	Rheinsberg Nuclear Powerplant
	Kernkraftwerk Rheinsberg (K.K.R.) WWER type reactor

	Experienced a tear in the tubing of a cooling 
	circuit in sector alpha.
^n

	This was noticed quickly and the signal was sent. 
^n

	Under normal circumstances, the problem would've 
	been resolved before the public even heard about it.
^n

	But there was no response back, and the whole 
	place went up in flames. Sabotage is suspected.
^n
^s1
	Teens and crackheads in the area are getting too 
	curious and exploring areas they're not supposed to.
^n

	Although we've lost any visual feed on the 
	facilities, motion sensors are being tripped. 
^n

	Most of these are likely false-alarms or just 
	some animal that got lost, but we have reason to 
	believe that outsiders and a number of personnel 
	are still inside.
^n

	We've sent the signal to remotely close the doors, 
	but it's only a matter of time before they find 
	their way out.
^n
^s1
	You'll be issued with a standard law 
	enforcement pistol among other things.
^r 
Am I to arrest trespassers?

>> "Am I to arrest trespassers?"
>> Message sent
^p

	Arrest? No, these people are fucking with actual 
	classified information. They need to be put down 
	like a rabid dog.
^n
^s1
	This operation is extremely secretive, so funds 
	are scarce.
^n

	However, this facility was extensively stocked 
	in the event of an emergency. You'll find more 
	equipment in these locations.
^n

	We heavily advice you to take whatever equipment 
	you can find - anything you think's useful.
^n

	Meet me at the shop, and we'll tell you 
	the rest on the way.
