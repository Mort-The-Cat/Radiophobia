They say that a frog, put in a pot of water on the stove, will not notice if you slowly turn up the heat. It is said that it will sit there until it cooks itself to death without a second thought.

But that's not the full story

In this experiment, the frogs were extensively lobotomised before the procedure, crippling their most basic sensory responses to pain. This is seemingly quite a clear-cut explanation of this phenomenon. It explains why those frogs didn't jump, and this is often used to show the unreliability of this experiment's findings.

However, it is telling that, upon first finding out about this, people accept and understand how such a thing could happen. We accept this. Perhaps, unreliable or not, the fact that this experiment's ideas were accepted without question by us is a testament to its truth.

We don't notice how time's passing until we look back up at the clock. The temperature's rising.

The motions and contractions of life mirror the structure of music, creating tension and releasing it- antecedent consequent phrases. Cramps, breaths, heartbeats, all pulsate in a musical, lively way. 

If it was not so, it'd be hard to even say it was alive.
